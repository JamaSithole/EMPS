Most Importantly
	Need to make sure that Env variable points to the correct environment when taking things to the server
	
	
Deployment Notes
	1. If you have added any new table please update the persistance.xml file in the config folder as to reflect the made changes
	2. Depending on the environment you are deploying to please replace the confiq files accordingly, 
			i.e services-config.xml and persistence.xml
	3. Update the ENV field in userepms table with respect to the environment of interest, TST for TEST and DEV for development. 
			This need to be improved through congiq file, I will make time for it.
			
NB : 
	Clean and build will avoid u too much of trouble after replacing the confiq files, just do a clean and build before exporting the war file
